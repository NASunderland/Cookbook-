    "No second proof needed — bake after shaping.",
    "Optional: Rest shaped dough for 10–15 mins for puffier crust.",
    "Avoid sticking: Use semolina or plain flour on peel. Almond flour not recommended (burns easily, absorbs moisture).",
    "Emergency tip: If dough sticks to peel, gently lift and add more flour underneath or blow air under it.",
    "Plain flour works fine — dough will be softer. Only reduce water if it feels too sticky.",
    "Add garlic powder or oregano to the dough for extra flavour.",
    "Dough can be frozen in balls. Defrost overnight before using."
